"""Cross-process invalidation for the tenant -> shard routing cache.

Every process caches tenant -> shard resolutions in memory (see ``shard_routing``).
When the migrator moves a tenant it flips the ``tenant_shard`` row, but each process
keeps serving its cached answer until that entry expires. Routing a request with a
stale answer sends reads *and writes* to the database the tenant just moved off, so
the TTL alone is not an acceptable propagation mechanism during a migration.

This module adds a shared version counter in Redis. The migrator bumps it after a
flip; every process re-reads it on a short interval and drops its whole local cache
when it changes. Propagation is bounded by the poll interval rather than the TTL.

Two deliberate choices:

- **Read from the primary, not a replica**, so replica lag stays out of the
  correctness argument for a flip. It's one GET per process per interval.
- **A Redis failure does not invalidate** — the cache is left alone and the TTL is the
  backstop. So the migrator must treat Redis as a precondition for a flip, not an
  optimization; see ``shard_map_propagation_seconds``.
