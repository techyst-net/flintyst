"""Physical database ("shard") registry for tenant routing.

Onyx addresses a tenant by *schema* via ``schema_translate_map``. This module adds
the orthogonal axis: which *database* that schema lives in.

Design notes:

- The default shard's engine is owned by :class:`onyx.db.engine.sql_engine.SqlEngine`,
  not by this module. That keeps the ~20 existing ``init_engine`` call sites and the
  single-database deployment path completely unchanged.
- Non-default shard engines are created lazily here, on first use, mirroring the pool
  configuration the default engine was initialized with.
- With no ``ONYX_DB_SHARDS`` configured there is exactly one shard and this module is
  a thin pass-through to ``SqlEngine``.

Connection budget: the *total* pool across shards is held roughly constant rather than
multiplied per shard — see ``divide_pool_budget``. Multiplying it would put N times the
connection load on the database/pooler, which is how this deployment has hurt itself
before.
