resurrected in the target index — the port's create-only write can't tell a just-deleted
chunk from a never-written one, so a copy landing after the delete re-adds the doc (which
then has no Postgres row and is never cleaned up). The port marks its writes; the sweep
deletes only those marked chunks for a recorded doc. See
