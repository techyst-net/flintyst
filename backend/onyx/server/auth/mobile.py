"""Mobile auth gateway.

Native mobile clients (Expo / React Native) authenticate against the SAME
backend as web, but receive the existing stateful session token as a Bearer
value instead of an HttpOnly cookie. This module owns the mobile-facing auth
surface.

V1 (this PR): email/password login, refresh, and logout, mounted from the
shared fastapi-users machinery against the `mobile-bearer` backend. The Google
SSO bridge (`/auth/mobile/sso/exchange`) is added in a later PR.
