"""Classify an MCP streamable-HTTP request into a gate verdict input.

Every tool invocation is a JSON-RPC ``tools/call`` carrying the exact tool
name, so the gate parses the body (precedent:
``external_apps/matching/graphql_parsing.py``) rather than guessing from the
URL. Protocol plumbing passes ungated; anything else on a matched MCP host is
UNCLASSIFIABLE and fails closed — credential injection covers the whole host,
so an unrecognized request must never forward with credentials.
