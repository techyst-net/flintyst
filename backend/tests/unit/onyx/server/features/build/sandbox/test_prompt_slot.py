"""Tests for ``KubernetesSandboxManager.prompt_slot``.

Empirical finding (E2E chaos test, 2026-05-23): opencode-serve's
``prompt_async`` is fire-and-forget and not concurrent-safe. A second
POST against a busy session returns 2xx but is silently dropped; the
second subscriber's bus catches the *first* turn's terminator and emits
PromptResponse as if turn 2 succeeded, while a phantom user_message gets
persisted with no assistant reply.

The fix: a per-(sandbox_id, build_session_id) lock, acquired non-
blocking before user_message persistence. Keying on build_session_id
(not opencode_session_id) is deliberate — the opencode id can rotate
mid-turn via the on_opencode_session_resolved callback, and keying on
it would let concurrent requests in the recovery path acquire
different locks and bypass serialization. These tests lock the
contract.

Bypasses ``_initialize`` (no K8s config needed) — pure lock logic.
