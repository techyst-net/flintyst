"""
Overrides the integration framework's in-process ``_test_client`` autouse with a
real httpx.Client, plus seeds a Slack ``external_app`` so the gate flow can
fire.

The default ``tests/integration/conftest.py::_test_client`` builds an in-process
FastAPI ``TestClient``. That works for tests where the "api_server" being
asserted against is the test process itself. It does NOT work for the docker e2e
-- those tests provision real sandbox containers via the docker socket, and
``DockerSandboxManager.provision`` blocks on a health-check against
``http://sandbox-<id8>:4096``, a hostname that only resolves inside the
``onyx_craft_sandbox`` bridge network. The in-process api_server lives on the
host net and can never resolve it.

The fix: hit the dockerized api_server (port-published at host 8080 by
``docker-compose.dev.yml``) instead. From the host, ``localhost:8080`` -> the
api_server container, which is on both the default and ``onyx_craft_sandbox``
networks and CAN resolve sandbox hostnames.

The Slack seeding is needed because the default deployment has no external apps
configured. ``ExternalAppActionMatcher`` only claims a request if some app's
``upstream_url_patterns`` matches the URL; without a Slack row,
``chat.postMessage`` is treated as off-catalog and not gated.
``AUTO_PROVISION_DEFAULT_EXTERNAL_APPS`` defaults to off and the K8s lane
doesn't actually run ``test_approval_gate.py`` either (it's not listed in the
lane's paths filter or pytest args), so this fixture is the first place to wire
the seeding in CI.

This conftest is intentionally scoped to ``docker_e2e/`` only. Sibling craft
tests under ``tests/integration/tests/craft/`` keep the in-process model.
