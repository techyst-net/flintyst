"""File-store layout and lifecycle for admin log exports.

All state for one export lives under ``log_export/{export_id}/`` in the default
file store: one ``piece_{hostname}.zip`` per container plus one
``receipt_{worker_name}.json`` per fanned-out worker. Shared by the collector
celery tasks and the log-export API endpoints.

    store), so export readiness must also be bounded by a deadline.
